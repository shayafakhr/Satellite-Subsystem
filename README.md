# 🌐 3U CubeSat Mechanical Design and Subsystems

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on designing a 3U CubeSat with a focus on mechanical design and subsystem integration. The CubeSat is designed using SolidWorks for mechanical structure, while MATLAB is used for control and subsystem simulation. The project covers power management, communication, attitude control, and payload handling, emphasizing modularity and functionality.

## 📌 Objectives

- Design a complete 3U CubeSat with accurate mechanical dimensions.
- Implement and simulate each subsystem (Power, Communication, Attitude Control, Payload) in MATLAB.
- Test the functionality of each subsystem independently and in an integrated manner.
- Document the design, simulation results, and system performance.

## 🌟 Subsystems

### 1. Power Subsystem

- Manages power generation (solar panels), storage (batteries), and distribution.
- Includes power regulation and monitoring.

### 2. Communication Subsystem

- Establishes communication with ground stations using radio frequency (RF) modules.
- Supports data transmission and reception protocols.

### 3. Attitude Control Subsystem

- Maintains satellite orientation using reaction wheels and gyroscopes.
- Implements control algorithms (PID, Quaternion-based control).

### 4. Payload Subsystem

- Handles mission-specific instruments or sensors (e.g., cameras, sensors).
- Manages data acquisition and processing.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- SolidWorks for mechanical design and part modeling.
- MATLAB for control, simulation, and subsystem logic.
- Simulink (optional) for graphical simulation of control systems.
